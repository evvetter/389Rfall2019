### Part 2 (75 pts)

Wrote a parser to read the captcha, then to compute the expected result. After that, I created an iterator to run through rockyou.txt for each line in the file, printing the current password and success/fail result for each. The "count" value on the iterator was made because of connection issues causing the script to fail, so I could start back up where the connection failed.
